# this is simply to work through a basic iteration of this to show Michail
# let's say we want to split one beta into 5 Dirichlet's.
# We get this beta from the answers to one question regarding whales moving from SEUS north to MIDA
# in this example the person indicates that 30 whales make the transition, and their confidence is 7:
beta1 <- rbeta(1, 30, 7)

# So!
