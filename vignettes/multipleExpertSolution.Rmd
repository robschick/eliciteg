In the `multipleExpertProblem` vignette, I raised the issue of how I was struggling to get good c values returned from the `calcC` function, which in return was causing `calcK` to return `NA` values. I showed these to Michail, and he corrected my indexing of the data/prior combo that was going into these functions. Specifically, I was sending the whole 9*9 matrix, when I really wanted to be sending a 1 * 9 vector for both of the data and the prior. 

I tried first tackling this with `mapply()`, but didn't get very far.
